# LFM2.5-VL Decisions

## D-0001: Direct Candle Fork

Status: Accepted

Decision:
Work directly from Candle 0.11.0 rather than building a wrapper around an unmodified dependency.

Why:
The planned implementation requires changes to LFM2 construction, embedding forwarding, model registration, examples, and quantized loading.

Consequences:
The repository retains upstream Candle history and should keep unrelated diffs minimal.

## D-0002: WSL2-First Development

Status: Accepted

Decision:
Use a Linux-home WSL2 checkout as the authoritative development and verification environment.

Why:
The execution plan calls for Linux filesystem behavior and avoids the permission, symlink, and performance problems of a Windows-mounted source tree.

Consequences:
The Windows-mounted edit worktree is not the build or verification authority.

## D-0003: CPU F32 Before CUDA

Status: Accepted

Decision:
All component parity must pass on CPU F32 before CUDA-specific work.

Why:
This separates model and preprocessing defects from accelerator precision and kernel defects.

Consequences:
Initial performance is not an acceptance criterion.

## D-0004: 450M Before 1.6B

Status: Accepted

Decision:
Use LFM2.5-VL-450M as the first production checkpoint, followed by 1.6B.

Why:
The 450M dimensions expose the current Candle normalization defect that the 1.6B dimensions can accidentally hide.

Consequences:
The 1.6B checkpoint remains a required second compatibility test.

## D-0005: Native Safetensors Before GGUF

Status: Accepted

Decision:
Prove native safetensors loading and CPU parity before adding quantized text, split mmproj, or direct GGUF mmproj support.

Why:
Starting with GGUF would combine model-math, preprocessing, tensor-name, layout, and quantization failures in one debugging surface.

Consequences:
GGUF work remains out of scope for Bootstrap Phase and the initial native parity gate.

## D-0006: Production Model Files Excluded From Git

Status: Accepted

Decision:
Do not commit production checkpoints, Hugging Face caches, generated runtime output, or local reference downloads.

Why:
These artifacts are large, mutable, and not part of the source or deterministic tiny-fixture contract.

Consequences:
Only reviewed deterministic tiny fixtures may be committed under `tests/fixtures/lfm2_vl_tiny/`.

## D-0007: Linked Edit and Linux Verification Worktrees

Status: Accepted

Decision:
Use `C:\DevStuff\candle-mods` only as the linked Windows edit worktree for Codex-authored changes. Keep the authoritative checkout and all verification work in Linux-home WSL2 worktrees. Builds and baseline checks never run from `/mnt/c` or `/mnt/d`.

Why:
The edit worktree is detached and linked to the authoritative WSL repository; the project execution plan requires Linux-home filesystem behavior.

Consequences:
Only Linux-home verification worktree evidence may be recorded as green. Cargo checks never run in the Windows edit worktree.

## D-0008: Local Verification Lockfile

Status: Accepted

Decision:
Keep `Cargo.lock` ignored and local to each Linux verification lane. Require it for every `--locked` check and record its SHA-256 with the retained proof.

Why:
Upstream Candle 0.11 intentionally ignores `Cargo.lock`, but the sprint requires locked local verification. Committing a workspace lockfile would change upstream repository policy before implementation evidence justifies it.

Consequences:
A fresh verification lane must resolve the lockfile deliberately, hydrate only the required local dependencies, and then run the phase verifier offline. Different lock hashes are different proof environments and must not be compared as identical baselines.
